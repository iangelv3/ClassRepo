<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Hello, Im Angel Vargas and I am 20 years old. I was born in Millwaukee Wisconsin<br>                                 	
But i have lived in millwaukee wisoncin for most of my life. I have 2 younger<br>                                           
siblings and i am the oldest of them all. i have been interested in game/web<br>
design ever since i was smaller and now being able to actually go and start <br> 
doing what i always wanted to do is something I find very extraordianary in <br>
all terms.</p> 

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Things that I want to excel at is that i would want to learn more towards HTML <br>
and JavaScript. And also be more efficient when it comes to learning more photoshop <br>
and going more in depth towards indesign and all the other apps that i would like to <br>
achieve more in towards later terms.</p>

<h2>Software/Hardware</h2>
<p>I would say I have some experience when it comes to graphic design. Not much,<br> 
but to be able to work to the ground up and be able to actually conclude that<br>
I have some experience towards that, also I know how to work premiere a little <br>
bit, also when it comes to indesign and after effects i know a sufficient amount <br>
to pass by.</p>
